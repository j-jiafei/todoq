{"body":"# TODOQ\r\n\r\nTo be released soon.\r\n\r\nThe simplest command-line TODO list for work, which leads extremely focus.\r\n\r\nI like TODO list, and I have used quite a lot of them, but sadly none of them fits me well.\r\nFirst, when I look at the long list of tasks to do, I am scared and bored, and I turn to\r\nprocrastinate.\r\n\r\nSecond, I am a VIM lover, and I use command-line tools for almost all of my programming stuff,\r\nfrom my work to my part-time projects. I don't want to open a browser, or some apps to distract me.\r\n\r\nThird, I find I wast my time on tasks priority management. When I look at my TODO, I arrange them occasionally\r\nto make sure the order is according to priority. This is time overhead for TODO list, and I hope I could save\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons why I come up with the idea of TODOQ. It is very simple, but fully functional. You can add\r\ntasks, check the top task, postpone or delete it. The tasks are ordered by priority, and you can create several queues\r\nfor multiple-task processing.\r\n\r\nThere is another story about single-task display. There is a theory about programmers that if you want him to make a website\r\nin two weeks, he intends to procrastinate until there are just two days left, and then finish it in a messy way. If you just\r\ntell him that to fix a bug this afternoon, he may do it pretty well. The theory may not apply to you, and I believe for most\r\nones, single task is enough to keep them focused and working efficiently.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n### add [task name] [priority]\r\n\r\nAdd a task into the current queue. If the last including-no-space string is a number, it will be used as priority.\r\nPriority can be any unsigned int, so you can set any large or crazy number as you want. If no priority is specified, 17\r\nis set as the default priority.\r\n\r\ne.g. add finish the front page UI design 999\r\ntask name - finish the front page UI design\r\npriority - 999\r\n\r\ne.g. add check email\r\ntask name - check email\r\npriority - 17\r\n\r\n\r\n### top\r\nDisplay the top task. Yes, you are right, just the top one task.\r\n\r\n### postpone\r\nPostpone the top task, and you need to select one from the tasks to advance it to top.\r\n\r\n### delete\r\nDelete the top task. Yes, you can only delete the top one. This is designed on purpose, because we hope to make the\r\nTODO list management overhead as small as possible.\r\n\r\n### peek\r\nHIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED\r\nList all the tasks in the current queue.\r\n\r\n### showq\r\nList all the queues. Single queue is recommended. Multiple queues are designed for those\r\nwho like multiple-thread processing.\r\n\r\n### select [queue name]\r\nSelect the queue as the current queue.\r\n\r\n### create [queue name]\r\nCreate a new queue.\r\n\r\n### help | ?\r\nShow help. Any weird command will also lead to help.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nApache license is applied if you want to use the source code.\r\n[ http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n","google":"","tagline":"The simplest command-line task manager, which helps extremely focus.","note":"Don't delete this file!
