The todo list should help users focus on work.\r\n2. The task management overhead should be minimized.\r\n\r\nPersonally I am a todo list enthusiast. Starting from paper and pencil when I was in high school, I have been trying to use\r\ntodo list to help me schedule my life. I explored and used different methods and tools to help me track the status of\r\ndaily tasks. Some of the tools are pretty cool, and I actually used them for quite while. But from my experience, I found that I\r\nnever kept using a single tool for more than two weeks. At first, I might be attracted to a tool and make up my mind for a resolution\r\nto make my life well-planed. But soon I found that the tool does not actually help me much on focus and getting things done, but the\r\noverhead to manage the todo list itself is pretty high.\r\n\r\nNow as a research assistant, a side-project developer and a student at the same time. I use command-line tools quite a lot every day.\r\nSometimes I use web-based todo list to help me track problems to solve, features to implement, or bugs to fix. But switching between\r\ncommand line and browser can be a pain sometimes, and looks less professional. Such a switching could also be distracting sometimes.\r\n\r\nThen my friends and I decide to write a todo list tool for developers like us, basically command-line everything guys =). We hope it \r\ncould be really light-wight, \"prevent\" over-managing task list, and help focus on work. So we come up with the idea of single-task\r\ndisplay todo list. Instead of displaying all the tasks, we simply show the top one, the one with the highest priority. Operations,\r\nlike \"finish\", \"drop\", \"postpone\", are only limited to the top one to minimize the todo list management overhead. Tasks can still be\r\nlisted with the command \"peek\", which is highly not recommended. We hope users could just focus on the top task at the moment, and thinking\r\nabout other tasks only when absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nYou may find such a design may be inconvenient sometimes. You may want to arrange the order of tasks, set a deadline for it, or simply drop\r\nsome of them. These operations are almost unsupported in TodoQ. Instead, for the order, we use priority (basically any unsigned int number between\r\n0 and whatever python int type supports). The tasks are ordered based on priority completely. We don't use deadline for tasks. We believe that\r\nhuman mind should be able to transform urgency to priority easily, and for work, a good way to meet a deadline is to do it as early as possible.\r\nYou may want to drop some of tasks since you have finished them, or they are not necessary any more, but why not do it later, cause managing todo\r\nlist itself could also be \"viewed\" as a task with not-the-highest priority.\r\n\r\nWe hope you could enjoy using TodoQ, and make it help you improve your valuable productivity.\r\n\r\n \r\n## Install\r\n\r\nFirst-time install:\r\npip install todoq\r\n\r\nFor update:\r\npip install todoq -U\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### todoq add task\\_name priority\r\n\r\nAdd a task into the current queue. If the last including-no-space string is a number, it will be used as priority.\r\nPriority can be any unsigned int, so you can set any large or crazy number as you want. A priority is forced to given,\r\nand should be different from that of any other task.\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\ntodoq add \"finish the front page UI design\" 999\r\ntask name - finish the front page UI design\r\npriority - 999\r\n\r\ne.g. \r\ntodoq add \"check email\" 10\r\ntask name - check email\r\npriority - 10\r\n\r\n\r\n### todoq top\r\n\r\nDisplay the top task. Yes, you are right, just the top one task.\r\n\r\n### todoq finish\r\n\r\nMark the top task as \"finished\".\r\n\r\n### todoq postpone priority\r\n\r\nPostpone the top task.\r\n\r\n### todoq drop\r\n\r\nMark the top task as \"dropped\".\r\n\r\n### todoq list\r\n\r\nList all the tasks in the current queue. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n\r\n* \\-u: list all the unfinished tasks\r\n* \\-a: list all the tasks\r\n* \\-f: list all the finished tasks\r\n* \\-d: list all the dropped tasks\r\n* \\-n [count]: specifiy the number of tasks to be displayed\r\n\r\n### todoq showq\r\n\r\nList all the queues. Single queue is recommended. Multiple queues are designed for those\r\nwho like multiple-thread processing.\r\n\r\n### todoq selectq queue\\_id\r\n\r\nSelect the queue as the current queue.\r\n\r\n### todoq createq queue\\_name\r\n\r\nCreate a new queue.\r\n\r\n### todoq deleteq queue\\_name\r\n\r\nDelete an existing queue.\r\n\r\n### todoq --help, todoq -h, todoq help\r\n\r\nShow help. Any weird commands will also lead to help.\r\n\r\n### todoq setpath path\r\n\r\nSet the directory path to store all todoq queue information and task\r\ninformations.\r\n\r\nThe default is ~/.todoq in Linux/Unix. The path could be set to be a\r\nsubdirectory of Dropbox, and then the tasks can be synchronized automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nApache license is applied if you want to use the source code.\r\n[ http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n","name":"TodoQ","tagline":"The simplest command-line todo list, which helps with extreme focus.","google":"UA-38085715-1"}
