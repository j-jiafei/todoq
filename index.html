        <h1>TodoQ</h1>

<p>The simplest command-line todo list to help you focused better at work.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>TodoQ is a single-task-display, priority-based, command-line todo list (I don't
know whether someone has come up with such a concept as single-task display).</p>

<p>"Single-task-display" means that usually it only displays the top task, and you
can "finish", "drop" or "postpone" it.</p>

<p>"Priority-based" means the order of tasks is totally based on priority, which is
an unsigned int (whichever python int type supports).</p>

<p>"Command-line" means it is run by linux / unix (mac included) terminal.</p>

<p>TodoQ also supports multiple queues, in case you want to work in multiple
threads at the same time in a period.</p>

<p>We also support the sync of tasks, and dropbox account is required if you want to use the feature.</p>

<h2>The story behind the design of TodoQ</h2>

<p>We hope to design the world's simplest command-line todo list, and we have two
basic goals for it:</p>

<ol>
<li>The todo list should help users focus on work.</li>
<li>The task management overhead should be minimized.</li>
</ol><p>Personally I am a todo list enthusiast. Starting from paper and pencil when I
was in high school, I have been trying to use todo list to help me schedule my
life. I explored and used different methods and tools to help me track the
status of daily tasks. Some of the tools are pretty cool, and I actually used
them for quite while. But from my experience, I found that I never kept using a
single tool for more than two weeks. At first, I might be attracted to a tool
and make up my mind for a resolution to make my life well-planed. But soon I
found that the tool does not actually help me much on focus and getting things
done, but the overhead to manage the todo list itself is pretty high.</p>

<p>Now as a research assistant, a side-project developer and a student at the same
time. I use command-line tools quite a lot every day.  Sometimes I use web-based
todo list to help me track problems to solve, features to implement, or bugs to
fix. But switching between command line and browser can be a pain sometimes, and
looks less professional. Such a switching could also be distracting sometimes.</p>

<p>Then my friends and I decide to write a todo list tool for developers like us,
basically command-line everything guys =). We hope it could be really
light-wight, "prevent" over-managing task list, and help focus on work. So we
come up with the idea of single-task display todo list. Instead of displaying
all the tasks, we simply show the top one, the one with the highest priority.
Operations, like "finish", "drop", "postpone", are only limited to the top one
to minimize the todo list management overhead. Tasks can still be listed with
the command "peek", which is highly not recommended. We hope users could just
focus on the top task at the moment, and thinking about other tasks only when
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>You may find such a design may be inconvenient sometimes. You may want to
arrange the order of tasks, set a deadline for it, or simply drop some of them.
These operations are almost unsupported in TodoQ. Instead, for the order, we use
priority (basically any unsigned int number between 0 and whatever python int
type supports). The tasks are ordered based on priority completely. We don't use
deadline for tasks. We believe that human mind should be able to transform
urgency to priority easily, and for work, a good way to meet a deadline is to do
it as early as possible.  You may want to drop some of tasks since you have
finished them, or they are not necessary any more, but why not do it later,
cause managing todo list itself could also be "viewed" as a task with
not-the-highest priority.</p>

<p>We hope you could enjoy using TodoQ, and make it help you improve your valuable
productivity.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>First-time install:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install todoq
</code></pre>

<p>Update:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install todoq -U
</code></pre>

<p>Uninstall:</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip uninstall todoq
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Add a new task</h3>

<pre><code>todoq add task_name priority
</code></pre>

<p>Add a task into the current queue. If the last including-no-space string is a
number, it will be used as priority.  Priority can be any unsigned int, so you
can set any large or crazy number as you want. A priority is forced to given,
and should be different from that of any other task.</p>

<p>Example #1</p>

<pre><code>todoq add "finish the front page UI design" 999
</code></pre>

<p>task name - finish the front page UI design
priority - 999</p>

<p>Example #2</p>

<pre><code>todoq add "check email" 10
</code></pre>

<p>task name - check email
priority - 10</p>

<h3>Show the top task</h3>

<pre><code>todoq top
</code></pre>

<p>Display the top task. Yes, you are right, just the top one task.</p>

<h3>Finish the top task</h3>

<pre><code>todoq finish
</code></pre>

<p>Mark the top task as "finished".</p>

<h3>Postpone the top task</h3>

<pre><code>todoq postpone [priority]
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>priority</code> is specified, the top task is postponed with the new priority.
Otherwise, the top task is postponed after the second task.</p>

<h3>Drop the top task</h3>

<pre><code>todoq drop
</code></pre>

<p>Mark the top task as "dropped".</p>

<h3>Show the complete task list</h3>

<pre><code>todoq list
</code></pre>

<p>List all the tasks in the current queue. The sub-command should be used rarely
to avoid distraction.</p>

<p>Options</p>

<pre><code>-u: list all the unfinished tasks
-a: list all the tasks
-f: list all the finished tasks
-d: list all the dropped tasks
-n count: specifiy the number of tasks to be displayed
</code></pre>

<h3>Show all the task queues</h3>

<pre><code>todoq showq
</code></pre>

<p>List all the queues. Single queue is recommended. Multiple queues are provided
in case you have multiple projects at hand.</p>

<h3>Select a task queue</h3>

<pre><code>todoq selectq queue_name
</code></pre>

<p>Select the queue as the current queue.</p>

<h3>Create a new task queue</h3>

<pre><code>todoq createq queue_name
</code></pre>

<p>Create a new queue.</p>

<h3>Delete a task queue</h3>

<pre><code>todoq deleteq queue_name
</code></pre>

<p>Delete an existing queue.</p>

<h3>Show usage</h3>

<pre><code>todoq --help, todoq -h, todoq help
</code></pre>

<p>Show help. Any "unexpected" command will also lead to help.</p>
